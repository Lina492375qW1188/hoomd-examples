# alchemy-mc

digital alchemy is an inverse design technique based on extended ensemble method.

Target structures:

Shape move - Simple cubic

Truncation - FCC

Doing digital alchemy on truncated tetrahedron family is trivial because varying degree of truncation also varys B2 virial coefficient.

B2 virial coefficient is defined as 1+3*asphericity, where asphericity can be checked using coxeter.
